# ðŸ“œ y25 Portfolio
I decided to come back to my old Portfolios and create a new portfolio with new improved ideas. This time I plan on creating this with Node.js since I wanted to work with SCSS for styling.

## ðŸ“¢ Features
- Automatically compiles `src/styles/` SCSS files to `public/styles/` CSS.
- Minifies all JavaScript files in `src/js` into a single `main.min.js` in `public/js`.
- Keeps SCSS, JavaScript, and assets well-structured.
- Automatically updates CSS when SCSS files are modified.
